## How To Run

To run the application in development mode, follow these steps:

> **ðŸ’¡ Note** </br>
> You will not be able to start the backend server without access to our `.env` file. As a result, you can still run the frontend, but the application will display no data, and much of the functionality will be unavailable. This is a security measure to protect our database from unauthorized access or modifications.


1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    # SSH
    git clone git@git.ntnu.no:IT2810-H24/T33-Project-2.git

    # HTTPS
    git clone https://git.ntnu.no/IT2810-H24/T33-Project-2.git

    cd T33-Project-2
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

3. **Start the backend development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev:backend
    ```

    Runs on [localhost:4000/graphql](localhost:4000/graphql)

4. **Open a `new ternimal` and start the frontend development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev:frontend
    ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.


## How To Test

How to run the tests in development mode, follow these steps:
 1. Run both the backend and frontend, 
 see **step 3 and 4 under the "How To Run"** section
 2. **Open a `new ternimal` and run the e2e test**:
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```


## Technology Used

- **React with TypeScript:** For building the frontend in a dynamic and type-safe way.
- **PostgreSQL:** A relational database for storing and managing our application data.
- **Apollo Server:** Serves as the GraphQL server for handling the API requests.
- **GraphQL:** Used to efficiently query and manage data between the frontend and backend.
- **shadcn/ui:** The component library used in the project to ensure for a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
