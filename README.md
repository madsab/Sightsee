## Folder Structure

To help navigate the codebase, hereâ€™s a quick overview of the main folders and their purpose:

- **/backend** - Contains backend-specific code for the application.

  - **/src** - Holds the core server files.
    - **/models** - Defines the data models used in the database (e.g., destination, user, review).
    - **/resolvers** - Contains GraphQL resolver functions that handle API requests and perform operations on the data models.

- **/cypress** - Contains end-to-end (e2e) test setup and test files.

  - **/e2e** - Houses specific e2e test files for different parts of the application, ensuring functionality is tested.

- **/frontend** - Contains all frontend-specific code and assets.
  - **/public** - Static assets accessible from the root URL.
  - **/src** - Holds the main application code for the frontend.
    - **/assets** - Contains images for the carousel.
    - **/components** - Reusable UI components for building various parts of the interface.
    - **/graphql** - Contains frontend GraphQL queries.
    - **/layouts** - Shared layout components for organizing the app structure across different pages.
    - **/lib** - Utility functions and helper code that support various features of the app.
    - **/pages** - Page-level components corresponding to each route in the application (e.g., Home, Browse, Profile).

## How To Run

To run the application in development mode, follow these steps:

> **ðŸ’¡ Note** </br>
> You will not be able to start the backend server without access to our `.env` file. As a result, you can still run the frontend, but the application will display no data, and much of the functionality will be unavailable. This is a security measure to protect our database from unauthorized access or modifications.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   # SSH
   git clone git@git.ntnu.no:IT2810-H24/T33-Project-2.git

   # HTTPS
   git clone https://git.ntnu.no/IT2810-H24/T33-Project-2.git

   cd T33-Project-2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. **Start the backend development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:backend
   ```

   Runs on [localhost:4000/graphql](localhost:4000/graphql)

4. **Open a `new ternimal` and start the frontend development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:frontend
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

## How To Test

### End to end tests

How to run the tests in development mode, follow these steps:

1.  Run both the backend and frontend,
    see **step 3 and 4 under the "How To Run"** section
2.  **Open a `new terminal` and run the e2e test**:

    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```

### Components tests

Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend file:

```bash
    cd frontend
```

Then run the tests from there:

```bash
    npm run test
```

## Design and Technology Choices

SightSee was developed to provide a smooth, interactive experience for users seeking information about tourist attractions. Below is an overview of the design and technology choices that drive the app's functionality and user experience.

### Frontend

- **React with TypeScript:** React enables dynamic, component-based interfaces that are efficient and scalable. TypeScript adds type safety, which reduces bugs and improves reliability in the code.
- **shadcn/ui:** This UI component library provides a cohesive and visually appealing interface across the app, maintaining a consistent design language throughout.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** A dark/light mode option allows users to switch display modes, enhancing usability in different lighting environments and providing a personalized experience.

### Backend

- **Apollo Server and GraphQL:** Apollo Server with GraphQL enables efficient data fetching, allowing only necessary data to be requested. This minimizes load times and reduces bandwidth usage, improving app performance.
- **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is used as the relational database for managing structured data and handling complex queries. It stores essential information such as user reviews and destination details.

### Functionality

- **Filtering, Sorting, and Search:** These features are implemented to allow users to easily filter, sort, and search for destinations based on their interests.
- **User Reviews and Ratings:** Users can read and submit reviews, contributing to a more interactive experience. Reviews are stored in PostgreSQL and managed through Appolo server and GraphQL, ensuring efficient data handling.
- **Responsive Design:** The frontend adapts to different screen sizes, allowing the application to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Cypress:** Cypress is used for end-to-end testing to validate key features, including search, filtering, and navigation. This framework simulates user interactions to verify that the application performs as expected across various scenarios.

### Overall Design Choices

The application is designed to offer a clear, intuitive, and visually appealing experience that prioritizes usability. We focused on reducing visual clutter while maintaining a modern, cohesive design. By using **shadcn/ui** as the component library, we ensured a consistent look across the entire application, with all components sharing a unified style for a seamless user experience.

Additionally, we prioritized accessibility by ensuring sufficient color contrast and selecting color palettes that accommodate users with color blindness, enhancing inclusivity for all users.
